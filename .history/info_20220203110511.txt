Determines the configuration of a scratch org, including which features and settings define its org shape. 
You can create a configuration file that your whole dev team can share.
- config/project-scratch-def.json

Using the single responsibility design principle, we delegate the display of the search 
results by firing an event that is handled by the Account Map and Account List components you create in later steps.
Create the event in the aura folder
sfdx force:lightning:event:create -n AccountsLoaded -d force-app/main/default/aura

#Assign permission set 
sfdx force:user:permset:assign -n Geolocation -u GeoTestOrg

#Load your sample data into the org. This is the data you exported from a different scratch org in a previous unit. 
sfdx force:data:tree:import -f data/Account.json -u GeoTestOrg
